# Arduino-Sensor-AM2302-DHT22-sensor
This is starter code to test out the AM2302/DTH22 humidity and temperature sensor

This is some source code to for the dozuki guide for the AM2302 temperature and humidity sensor.

This code should read the humidity of the room (in percentage) and the temperature of the room (in C and F).
